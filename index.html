						<h1>About the Creator</h1>
						<p>The Creator of this Website is named, Vince Kenneth Decamotan, currently studying as a Grade 9 student in PSHS-CRC, in section Lithium. What made the creator start this website is first, this is his Quarterly Project in the Second Quarter and second, he was greatly inspired by Aldous Huxley's Essay entitled, "Time and the Machines". This essay discusses how modernists forget how pre-industrialized individuals used to tell time. One method of telling the time is the moon. So, Vince made his website solely all about the Moon and its Phases. (click the photo to redirect to contacts)</p>

						<h3>/ˌnuː ˈmuːn/</h3>
						<p> - In astronomy, the new moon is the first lunar phase, when the Moon and Sun have the same ecliptic longitude. At this phase, the lunar disk is not visible to the naked eye, except when it is silhouetted against the Sun during a solar eclipse.</p>
						<br>
						<p> - The original meaning of the term 'new moon', which is still sometimes used in calendrical, non-astronomical contexts, is the first visible crescent of the Moon after conjunction with the Sun.</p>
						<br>
						<p> - At this phase, the lunar disk is not visible to the naked eye, except when it is silhouetted against the Sun during a solar eclipse.</p>

							<img src="pics/waxcrescwhite.png" width="345px" height="345px">
						</div>
						<h3>/ˈwæk.sɪŋ ˈkres.ənt/</h3>
						<p> - This phase is when the right side of the moon is illuminated, as the sun beings to move from behind the moon creating a crescent shape. </p>
						<br>
						<p> - The Waxing Crescent is the second phase in the cycle of phases. This Moon phase occurs once a month, rising around 9 AM, and setting around 9 PM, sticking around for approximately 7.38 days before going into the First Quarter phase.</p>
						<br>
						<p> - The Waxing Crescent phase is often referred to as the rebuilding phase. Once the moon has re-emerged with new energy, it is the perfect time to set new intentions for the month ahead and work on self-improvement.</p>

						<h3>/ˌfɝːst ˈkwɔːr.t̬ɚ/</h3>
						<p> - The first quarter moon definition is a primary moon that occurs during the third phase of the moon cycle. It is also referred to as a half-moon because half of the moon is illuminated by the sun.</p>
						<br>
						<p> - The First Quarter Moon phase is often a period where obstacles tend to raise their head and where decisions need to be made. This not a time to hesitate, but a time remove any obstacles and push forward.</p>

						<p> - The Waxing Gibbous Moon phase is a time for reflection. It's a time to look back on the life lessons you've learnt and the internal growth that has come from them and use this to adjust your current goals and life path accordingly.</p>
						<br>
						<p> - The waxing gibbous phase signals redirection, adjustment, and flexibility. Your plans are being challenged, and your patience is being tested. Be flexible. Have gratitude for this moment and look for signs and signals that are directing you to the best course of action.</p>
